2025-05-27T15:08:24.467007 - Q: how to apply for leave?
A: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to apply for leave based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, from the company leave policy, it's clear that all leave must be supported with a valid reason. So, before applying, I should have a good reason for taking off work. Next, I need to inform my supervisor or manager about the leave dates beforehand using e-Leave. That means I can't just go ahead and apply without letting them know.

The policy mentions that half-day leave is either from 9am-1pm or 2pm-6pm. The minimum period to apply for leave is half a day, which is 0.5 days. Now, looking at the unpaid leave section: during the probationary period (the first three months), there's no paid or unpaid sick leave. After that, if I take unpaid leave after my payroll is processed, it will be deducted from the next month's pay.

Another important point is that leave applications need to be submitted at least one week in advance for approval. But for leaves of one week or longer, I should apply three months in advance. This is to prevent too many team members from taking leave together, which could disrupt others' work during peak times.

Unused leave can't be carried over; only up to four days annually can be carried forward each year. So I need to plan my leave usage carefully among the team and inform the manager in advance.

There are also specific rules about mandatory attendance for certain events like Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch. If I can't attend with valid reasons, I need a day annual leave, especially if it's due toMaternity or Paternity Leave or during the holiday period. For sickness, I should have a medical certificate.

When applying for vacation or personal matters, there are some steps too: check with my manager first before booking plane tickets or tour packages on e-Leave. Also, I shouldn't take leave without approval; management might not approve it, so planning ahead is essential.

For mentors and managers, ensuring that there's at least one senior person in the team during long leaves is important to maintain continuity and avoid missing project deadlines.

Additionally, the leave application process is first-come-first-served. If someone else has already taken a date, I might have to choose another time or wait until it's available.

Putting this all together, the steps I should take when applying for leave are:

1. Decide on the reason and duration of my leave.
2. Notify my supervisor or manager about the dates beforehand using e-Leave.
3. Apply at least one week in advance if it's less than a week, or three months in advance if it's longer.
4. Plan around unused days to carry forward only four annual leaves per year.
5. For events like Christmas Lunch, ensure I have the necessary leave and documents (medical certificate if needed).
6. Book travel arrangements after getting manager approval.

I should also be prepared for cases where my application might not get approved immediately, so having a backup plan or alternative dates is wise. Plus, understanding that too much leave together can cause issues, so coordinating with team members is key.
</think>

To apply for leave effectively at the company, follow these organized steps:

1. **Determine Your Need**: Clearly identify the reason and duration of your leave.

2. **Notify Supervisor/Manager**: Inform your supervisor or manager about your leave dates using e-Leave as soon as possible.

3. **Application Timing**:
   - For less than a week: Apply at least one week in advance.
   - For longer leaves (one week or more): Submit the application three months in advance.

4. **Unused Leave Management**: Plan to carry forward only up to four annual leave days per year, ensuring timely usage to avoid forfeiture.

5. **Event Attendance**: For mandatory events like Christmas Lunch, secure the required leave and necessary documents (medical certificate if needed).

6. **Vacation or Personal Matters**: Book travel after securing manager approval through e-Leave.

7. **Alternate Dates**: Be prepared to choose alternative dates if applications are denied due to overlaps.

8. **Plan Ahead**: Coordinate with team members to avoid scheduling conflicts during peak times.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage your leave application and ensure smooth operations within the company.

2025-05-27T15:12:31.722581 - Q: How do I apply for leave?
A: <think>
Okay, so the user is asking, "How do I apply for leave?" They must be a new or occasional employee who doesn't know the process at this company. Let me go through the provided context step by step to figure out how they can apply for their leave.

First, looking at the company's leave policy. It says all leaves need valid reasons and should be informed to the supervisor or manager before applying via e-Leave. So I'll mention that they must inform their manager first with a reason key in before submitting.

Next, there are specific details about leave duration: half-day is 9am-1pm or 2pm-6pm. Minimum period is half a day, so if they're taking more than that, it's different. They should know the exact time frames for their type of leave.

Then, looking at the application process. It says minimum 1 week in advance for approval. For longer leaves, like over a week, they need to apply 3 months or earlier. That's important because if someone takes too much leave together, it can affect others. The user should know this to plan accordingly and avoid conflicts.

Unused leave is forfeited, so they have to be careful not to let their unused days go to zero. They can carry forward up to 4 days per year, which is a key point for them to manage their leaves properly.

The context also mentions that e-Leave won't encash any leaves anymore due to budget reasons. So no need to worry about converting days off into money; they should focus on using their leave wisely.

Additionally, there are specific rules for Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch. They must apply one day annual leave with valid reasons like maternity or paternity, etc., so the user needs to be aware of these mandatory applications.

For leaves related to personal matters or vacations, there are several steps: check with their manager first, book tickets only after approval on e-Leave, and apply officially for management's consent. Also, overlapping leave dates can cause issues, so they should plan their leave dates carefully to avoid conflicts within their department.

Mentors or managers need a senior team member covering if they're taking long leaves. The user might not be in a position where this applies yet, but it's good context for others.

The leave application is first-come-first-served with priorities given based on date availability. So if the dates are too similar, there might be competition, and they might have to choose alternative dates.

Putting all this together, I'll outline the steps clearly: inform manager, key in reason, apply via e-Leave at least a week before, note half-day specifics, longer leaves need 3 months notice, forfeit unused leave but can carry forward up to 4 days, and be aware of other specific policies like annual leave applications.

I should make sure the response is easy to follow, using bullet points or clear sections for each step so the user knows exactly what actions to take.
</think>

To apply for leave at this company, please follow these steps:

1. **Inform Your Manager**: Before applying for your leave via e-Leave, inform your supervisor or manager with a valid reason and ensure they approve it.

2. **Key in Your Reason**: Use the e-Leave system to input the specific reason for your leave request.

3. **Submit Your Application**: Apply for your leave at least 1 week in advance if it's less than half-day (0.5 days). For leaves longer than a week, apply at least 3 months or earlier.

4. **Be Aware of Leave Details**:
   - **Half Day Leave**: Follow the specific time frames provided.
   - **Unused Leave**: Unused leave will be forfeited, so plan your leave usage carefully.
   - **Maximum Carry Forward**: You can carry forward a maximum of 4 days of annual leave in a year.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - For long-term leaves (e.g., maternity or paternity), ensure there is coverage for your duties and projects.
   - Be mindful of overlapping leave dates within your department to avoid conflicts.

6. **Apply for Specific Leaves**: If you're applying for annual leave related to events like the Year End Staff Appreciation or Christmas Lunch, ensure you apply one day in advance with valid reasons.

7. **Check Leave Availability**: Apply for vacation or personal leaves on a first-come-first-served basis, prioritizing dates without overlapping leave within your department.

For further assistance, contact your manager or refer to the e-Leave system for detailed guidance.

2025-05-27T15:14:58.075809 - Q: How do I apply for leave?
A: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how someone can apply for leave based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, looking at the company's leave policy, all leaves must have a valid reason and be submitted before applying via e-Leave. That means you can't just decide to take time off without going through this process first. You need to inform your supervisor or manager of the leave dates beforehand when filling out the form on e-Leave.

The minimum period to apply for leave is half a day, so 0.5 days. Now, there are some specific rules about paid and unpaid leave during the probationary period. For the first three months, there's no paid or sick leave. If someone takes unpaid leave after that period, it gets deducted from their next month's pay. That’s something to keep in mind if you're planning leave during that initial phase.

Next, for leave applications of one week or longer, they must be submitted at least a month (3 weeks) in advance. This is because the company has policies about capacity planning—too many team members taking leaves together can disrupt others' schedules. So, applying early helps prevent this and ensures smoother operations. If someone needs to take a longer leave, planning well ahead is crucial.

Unused leave is forfeited, so you need to use your leave time wisely. Also, the company doesn't allow encashment anymore, meaning you can’t exchange unused leaves for cash. Additionally, only up to 4 days of annual leave can be carried forward each year, so planning how much leave you take and give to others is important.

There are specific requirements for Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch. If a staff member can't attend with valid reasons like Maternity or Paternity Leave applied in advance, they need one day of annual leave. Sick people should provide a medical certificate to be eligible.

For vacation or personal matters, there are several steps: checking with your manager first, booking plane tickets or tour packages only after official approval through e-Leave, and avoiding overlapping leave dates within the same department as much as possible. Mentors, managers, or leaders need at least one senior person in their team to cover their duties during long leaves for continuity.

Leave applications are on a first-come, first-served basis. If other team members have taken leave on certain dates, you might get a 50/50 chance if there's overlap; it's better to choose another date then.

Putting this all together, the process involves checking with your manager before booking anything, filling out the e-Leave application with valid reasons, applying at least one month in advance for longer leaves, managing unused leave wisely, and ensuring there’s no overlap within the team. Also, considering the capacity planning rule to prevent too many people taking leaves at once.

I should present this information clearly, step by step, without making up any rules beyond what's provided.
</think>

To apply for leave effectively at this company, follow these organized steps:

1. **Valid Reason and Documentation**: Ensure your leave request has a valid reason before proceeding.

2. **Submit via e-Leave**: Use the e-Leave system to fill out your application, providing all necessary details.

3. **Inform Supervisor/Manager**: Before applying online, inform your supervisor or manager of your leave dates.

4. **Minimum Period and Pro-Ration**: For the first three months (probationary period), there is no paid or sick leave. Unpaid leave taken after this period will be deducted from the next month's pay.

5. **Long Leave Planning**: Apply at least one month in advance for leaves longer than a week to ensure capacity planning and avoid scheduling disruptions.

6. **Unused Leave Management**: Use your leave wisely; only up to 4 days can be carried forward each year, so plan your usage with others.

7. **Special Events**: For Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch, apply one day annual leave if unable to attend due to valid reasons like Maternity or Paternity Leave. Provide a medical certificate for sick individuals.

8. **Vacation/Personal Matters**:
   - Check with your manager before booking travel arrangements.
   - Book tickets only after official approval through e-Leave.
   - Avoid overlapping leave dates within the same department; plan carefully to prevent disruptions.

9. **Capacity Planning**: Apply early if taking longer leaves to avoid overwhelming team schedules and ensure smooth operations.

10. **First-Come, First-Served Basis**: If there are overlapping dates with other team members' leave, you may get a 50/50 chance; choose another date if possible.

By following these steps, you can navigate the leave application process efficiently while adhering to company policies and ensuring smooth operations.

2025-05-27T15:18:34.017409 - Q: how do i apply for leave?
A: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to apply for leave based on the provided context. Let me read through it again.

First, all leaves must have a valid reason and be informed beforehand. So, I should know exactly why I'm taking leave before applying. The e-Leave system is required; I can't just inform my supervisor verbally or in person without using this system.

Looking at the details about half-day leave: it's either from 9am to 1pm AM or 2pm to 6pm PM, which makes sense as a typical workday break. The minimum period to apply is half a day (0.5 days), so if I need more than that, like full days off, the rules change.

Now, for the leave entitlements: there's no paid or unpaid sick leave during the probationary period, usually the first three months. After that, if someone takes unpaid leave after their payroll is processed, it'll be deducted from the next month's pay. That's a bit confusing, but I guess once you're past the probationary period, you have to manage your leave days carefully.

Leave applications need at least one week in advance for approval. For leaves longer than a week, they should be submitted three months or earlier. The reason is to prevent too many people from taking leaves together, which could disrupt team continuity and project timelines. So, planning ahead is key.

Unused leave can't be carried forward beyond four days annually. That means I have to be careful with how I use my leave days each year; otherwise, they might get lost. I should probably plan across the year so that everyone can take their necessary time off without overusing it.

There are specific instructions for Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch. If I can't attend due toMaternity, Paternity Leave, or holiday period, I need to apply one day annual leave in advance with a valid reason. For sickness, I must produce a medical certificate when applying.

When taking vacation or personal matters, there are some steps involved. Before booking plane tickets or tour packages, I have to check with my team leader for approval and then apply on e-Leave for management approval. Also, trying to book without prior approval isn't allowed. Additionally, overlapping leave dates within the same department should be minimized.

For mentors or managers, there needs to be at least one senior person in their team to cover their duties during long leaves. This is important to maintain team continuity and project timelines.

Leave applications are on a first-come, first-served basis, so if my preferred dates are taken by others, I might have to choose another date or give up the leave request.

Putting it all together, here's how I should apply for leave:

1. **Determine the reason**: Make sure I have a valid reason and communicate it before leaving.
2. **Submit via e-Leave**: Use the online system as required by policy.
3. **Specify dates**: Enter the exact days when I'll be off.
4. **Provide details**: Include any medical certificates if needed, like for sickness.
5. **Plan in advance**: For long leaves (more than a week), apply at least three months before to avoid last-minute issues and meet approval requirements.
6. **Check availability**: If my preferred dates are unavailable, adjust or choose another time frame.

I should also be mindful of the unused leave policy—carry it forward only up to four days annually to prevent forfeiture. Planning with my team and manager is crucial to avoid disrupting work continuity, especially during peak periods like Year End.
</think>

To apply for leave effectively, follow these organized steps based on company policy:

1. **Determine Valid Reason**: Ensure your leave request has a valid reason before starting the process.

2. **Submit via e-Leave**: Use the required online system to submit your application. This step is mandatory and must be communicated beforehand.

3. **Specify Leave Dates**: Enter the exact dates for your leave on the e-Leave platform. Consider team availability within your department to minimize overlaps.

4. **Provide Necessary Documents**:
   - For sick leave, ensure you have a medical certificate ready.
   - Communicate any absences related to personal reasons (e.g., Maternity/Paternity Leave) in advance with valid justification.

5. **Plan Ahead for Long Leaves**: For leaves longer than one week, apply at least three months in advance to meet approval requirements and avoid scheduling conflicts.

6. **Carry Forward Unused Leave**: Ensure you carry forward no more than four annual leave days to prevent forfeiture. Plan your usage across the year to manage this effectively.

7. **Coordinate with Team and Manager**:
   - For vacation or personal matters, check with your team leader for approval before booking arrangements.
   - For mentors, ensure there's a senior member available during periods of absence to maintain continuity.

8. **Follow Guidelines for Special Occasions**: For Year End events, apply one day annual leave in advance if unable to attend due to valid reasons like leave or sickness.

By following these steps, you can streamline your leave application process while adhering to company policies and maintaining team continuity and project timelines.

In terms of justification for not applying certain requirements of the standard, our organization has provided a clear explanation for any instances where this may be the case. This will provide transparency and ensure that all stakeholders understand the reasoning behind these decisions.

2025-06-30T02:58:38.551614 - Q: I have a physical meeting with a client later. what are some of the meeting etiquettes that i should take note of?
A: For your upcoming physical meeting with a client, here are some key meeting etiquettes to keep in mind:

Firstly, please arrive at least 10 minutes before the scheduled meeting time to demonstrate your punctuality and respect for the other person's time. If you know you're running late, be sure to call ahead and apologize.

When waiting to be ushered into the meeting room, take a seat in the opposite direction of the door, rather than facing it. This shows that you value their arrival and are eager to greet them warmly.

Upon noticing the client's arrival, stand up and smile warmly as they enter the meeting room. Be proactive and approach them to shake hands and introduce yourself while passing your name card.

Before the presentation begins, inform the receptionist or office tea assistant about your plans to use a laptop presentation, and request their IT colleague's assistance with setting up the projector/AV system. Ensure that the audio plug is working properly to ensure clear audio during the presentation.

Lastly, before starting your presentation, take a moment to thank the client for their time and introduce them to you and any other attendees.

2025-06-30T02:59:40.302327 - Q: how do i apply for leave?
A: To apply for leave, please follow these steps:

Firstly, please inform your supervisor or Manager of your leave date(s) before applying via e-Leave. You will also need to key in the reason for your leave when submitting your application.

For leave applications of 1 week and above, it is recommended that you apply at least 3 months (or earlier) in advance so that it can be approved or disapproved. This is to help with capacity planning and ensure that there are not too many team members on leave at the same time.

Additionally, if you will be unable to attend the Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch, please apply for one day of annual leave with a valid reason, such as being on maternity or paternity leave, or during a holiday period. If you are sick, please provide a Medical Certificate.

Please note that leave applications are applied on a first-come, first-served basis, so if no one in your team is taking leave on specified dates, you will have the first opportunity to approve your leave. However, if there are other team members taking leave on those dates, you may only have a 50/50 chance of having your leave approved.

Finally, please be aware that unused leave will be forfeited and that we do not offer leave encashment at any level within the company due to budgeting reasons. You can carry forward up to 4 days of Annual leave in a year.

2025-06-30T22:59:46.940852 - Q: why is my HR mad at me?
A: I'd be happy to help you understand why your HR might be upset with you. Based on the document, it seems that there could be a few reasons why your HR might be concerned.

Firstly, if you've made a mistake or caused an issue that needs to be addressed, your HR might be dealing with difficult callers who are complaining about the situation. In this case, your HR is likely following proper protocol to handle the situation and ensure it's resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner.

Another possibility is that you may have missed a deadline for submitting a leave request or failing to provide required documentation, such as a Medical Certificate (MC) or receipt. If this is the case, your HR might be reminding you of the importance of adhering to company policies and procedures, particularly when it comes to leave requests.

Lastly, if you're planning a long leave, including a leave for a specific purpose like attending a clinic, your HR might be concerned about ensuring continuity of work and team projects. They may require at least one senior person in your team to cover your duties during your absence.

To better understand the reason behind your HR's concerns, I would suggest checking with them directly or reviewing any relevant documentation or communication they've shared with you.

2025-06-30T23:55:35.228744 - Q: how do i apply for leave?
A: To apply for leave, please follow these steps:

First, inform your supervisor or Manager of your leave date(s) before applying via e-Leave. Make sure to submit your leave application with a valid reason.

Additionally, note that half-day leave is from 9am-1pm (AM) or 2pm-6pm (PM), and the minimum period to apply for leave is half a day (5 days).

For all leave applications, please plan ahead:

* If you're applying for leave within one week, submit your application at least 1 week in advance for approval.
* For leave applications of 1 week or above, apply your leave 3 months (or earlier) in advance to ensure it can be approved or disapproved due to capacity planning.

It's also worth noting that:

* During the probationary period (usually first 3 months), no paid leave or sick leave is allowed.
* If you're unable to attend the Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch, please apply for one day of annual leave in advance with a valid reason. If you're sick, be sure to produce a Medical Certificate.
* Leave is applied on a first-come-first-served basis, so if no one else has requested those dates, you'll have the approval opportunity. However, if there are team members taking leave on specified dates, your chances of getting approved may be affected, especially if there's a wide date span of overlaps.

Lastly, remember that:

* Unused leave will be forfeited.
* Leave encashment is no longer allowed at any level due to company budgeting reasons.

A: For your upcoming physical meeting with a client, here are some key meeting etiquette points to keep in mind:

Before starting your presentation, take a moment to thank the client for their time and introduce yourself to them.

By following these guidelines, you'll be able to make a positive impression on your client and ensure a productive meeting.

2025-07-01T02:15:02.992833 - Q: how do i apply for leave?
A: To apply for leave, please submit a leave application via e-Leave to your supervisor or manager before applying. You must also key in the reason for your leave before submitting your application.

Additionally, it's essential to note that there are specific requirements and guidelines to follow when requesting leave. For example, if you're taking a half-day leave, you can apply from 9am-1pm (AM) or 2pm-6pm (PM). The minimum period for applying leave is half a day (5 days).

It's also important to plan your leave utilization properly among your team and inform your team manager about it in advance. This helps with capacity planning, as too many members taking leave at the same time can affect other team members' ability to take leave.

When applying for leave, please ensure you're submitting it well in advance, especially if you're requesting a week or more of leave. You should apply your leave 3 months (or earlier) in advance to avoid any issues with approval.

2025-07-02T00:24:41.800759 - Q: can i eat in the pantry?
A: According to the Verztec Pantry Rules, it's not explicitly stated that eating is allowed in the pantry. However, it does mention that after having a meal in the office, you should clean up the countertops or tables with a damp cloth.

It's also mentioned that disposing of unwanted items and tidying up the fridge are part of maintaining a clean environment. While there isn't a direct mention of eating in the pantry, it's likely that eating is not allowed in the pantry to maintain its cleanliness and organization.

If you're unsure about whether you can eat in the pantry, I would suggest erring on the side of caution and not doing so. Instead, consider taking your meal to a designated eating area or outside the office where food disposal is more easily managed.

A: When it comes to internal meetings and client/prospect meetings, there are several key etiquette points to keep in mind. Firstly, during internal meetings, it's essential to give your full attention to the speakers. This means turning on your video, checking your sound and image, and ensuring you're well-lit before joining the meeting. Additionally, refrain from doing other work or tasks while in the meeting session, such as typing away on your keyboard or phone. If you have a question, concern, or wish to speak during the meeting, please don't hesitate to send a private message to the host instead of interrupting the discussion. It's also important to take notes during meetings so that you can remember the key points and apply them in your work. When it comes to client/prospect meetings, punctuality is crucial. Please arrive at least 10 minutes before the meeting time, and if you know you're going to be late, make sure to give the client a call to apologize and inform them. Upon entering the meeting room, please take a seat in the opposite direction from the door. When greeting clients, stand up, smile warmly, and shake hands with both hands. It's also essential to walk up to the client to pass your name card, rather than waiting for them to approach you. For laptop presentations, make sure to inform the receptionist or office tea assistant about the setup requirements in advance, and ask their IT colleague to assist with setting up the projector/AV system. Also, ensure that audio is plugged into their system to avoid any technical issues during the presentation. Before starting your presentation, always thank the prospect/client for their time and introduce them to you....

2025-07-02T17:06:06.359326 - Q: Why are my friends being so mean...
A: I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It can be really tough and hurtful when friends behave in a way that's mean or hurtful. There could be many reasons why your friends are behaving in this way, but here are some possible explanations: 1. **Stress and emotions**: People often say or do things they don't mean to when they're stressed, anxious, or upset. Your friends might be dealing with their own issues and taking it out on you. 2. **Miscommunication or misunderstandings**: Sometimes, people can misinterpret or misunderstand each other's intentions or words. This can lead to hurtful behavior that wasn't meant to be mean-spirited. 3. **Lack of empathy or understanding**: Unfortunately, some people might not be as considerate or empathetic towards others as they should be. They might not realize the impact their words or actions have on you. 4. **Group dynamics or peer pressure**: If your friends are part of a group or clique, there might be pressure to conform to certain behaviors or attitudes. This can lead to people saying or doing things they wouldn't normally do. 5. **Personal issues or conflicts**: Your friends might be dealing with personal problems or conflicts that aren't directly related to you, but still affect their behavior. What can you do? 1. **Talk to your friends**: Try to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about how their behavior is affecting you. Use "I" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or accusing language. 2. **Set boundaries**: Let your friends know what behaviors are and aren't acceptable to you. Be clear, firm, and assertive. 3. **Surround yourself with positive people**: If some of your friends are being mean or hurtful, it might be time to reevaluate the friendships that aren't serving you positively. 4....

2025-07-04T22:12:27.526751 - Q: tell me about verztec's meeting etiquette
A: At Verztec, we believe it's essential to establish a good rapport with our clients and colleagues through effective communication. When it comes to meetings, here are some key points to keep in mind:

Firstly, it's crucial to respect the speakers during a meeting session. This means giving your full attention to the conversation and avoiding distractions.

Before joining an internal meeting, make sure to turn on your video, check your audio and lighting, and dress professionally (Smart Casual for presentations with prospects or clients).

During the meeting, please refrain from doing other work tasks, such as typing away on your keyboard or phone. If you have a question or concern, it's best to mention it in a private message to the host.

Additionally, taking notes is essential so that you can remember key points and apply them in your work.

By following these guidelines, we aim to create a productive and respectful meeting environment that fosters open communication and collaboration.

A: I couldn't find any information on "Verztec." It's possible that it's a misspelling or a term that is not widely recognized. Can you please provide more context or clarify what Verztec refers to?

If you meant to ask about "Verzwulf" or another term, I'd be happy to try and help. Alternatively, if you have any specific information or details about Verztec, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.

However, I did find that there is a company called Verzweiflung (German for "despair"), but it's not well-known outside of Germany.

2025-07-04T22:21:06.609104 - Q: tell me about my annual leave policy
A: As a Verztec employee, it's essential to understand our annual leave policy to plan your time off effectively. Firstly, please note that we require advance notice for any leave application. If you're unable to attend the Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch due to valid reasons, such as maternity or paternity leave, holiday period, or being sick (with a Medical Certificate), you must apply one day's annual leave in advance. For birthday leave, it's recommended that you utilize your Annual Leave on your birthday month or actual birthday. New staff under probation can apply for leave after 2 months from their join date to avoid disrupting their training program. To ensure a smooth work experience, please clear all your leave by the end of your anniversary year to avoid forfeiting your Annual/Off days. It's also important to space out your leave and check with your department manager/supervisor to avoid clashing with team members. We take into account "No Pay Leave" taken in calculating employee's bonus, so please try to limit it to 7 days or less per year. Excessive sick leave (more than 50%) can affect your annual appraisal and bonus. As for our leave policy, full-time employees are entitled to the following number of leave days: * 0-3 years: 14 days * 1-5 years: 16 days * 6-10 years: 18 days * More than 10 years: 25 days It's also worth noting that we only allow a maximum of 4 days Annual Leave to be carried forward on a case-by-case basis, so please try to clear as much leave as possible before expiry. Additionally, if you apply for advanced leave on September 15th, it will be utilized under the new employment year's annual leave entitlement....

2025-07-04T22:26:53.950799 - Q: tell me about leave policy
A: The leave policy at Verztec is quite detailed and has several key points to consider. Firstly, all leave must be supported by a valid reason and approved by a supervisor or manager before submission via e-Leave. It's also essential to inform your manager of your leave dates in advance. There are specific guidelines for different types of leave. For example, half-day leave is only applicable from 9am-1pm (AM) or 2pm-6pm (PM). The minimum period to apply for leave is half a day, which is equivalent to five days. During the probationary period, typically the first three months, no paid sick leave or unpaid leave will be allowed. If an employee takes unpaid leave after payroll processing, it will be deducted in the next month's pay. For other leaves, such as vacation or personal matters, employees are required to submit their applications at least one week in advance for approval. For leave requests of one week or above, it's recommended to apply three months in advance to ensure capacity planning and avoid conflicts with team members' leave dates. Leave is applied on a first-come, first-served basis, which means that if no one in the team is taking leave on specified dates, you'll have the first opportunity for approval. However, if there are already team members taking leave on those dates, your chances of getting approved may be lower, especially if there's a wide date span of overlaps. Unused leave will be forfeited, and employees can only carry forward up to four days of annual leave in a year. It's essential to plan your leave utilization properly and inform your team manager about it in advance....

2025-07-04T22:32:53.561612 - Q: tell me about leave policy
A: At Verztec, our leave policy is designed to ensure that all employees take their leave in a way that supports the company's capacity planning and budgeting. Here are some key points to note: Firstly, all leave must be supported with a valid reason, and employees must inform their supervisor or manager of their leave date(s) before applying via e-Leave. When it comes to paid leave and sick leave during the probationary period (usually 3 months), no paid leave is allowed. However, unpaid leave taken after payroll is processed will be deducted in the next month's pay. For regular leave applications, employees must submit their request at least one week in advance for approval. For leave applications of one week or above, it's recommended to apply three months (or earlier) in advance to avoid conflicts with other team members' leave dates. Leave is applied on a first-come, first-served basis, which means that if no one in the team is taking leave on specified dates, you'll have the first approval opportunity. However, if there are multiple team members taking leave on the same dates, you may face competition and will be given a 50/50 chance of having your leave approved. It's also important to note that unused leave will not be encashable due to budgeting reasons. In fact, unused leave will be forfeited. However, employees can carry forward up to four days' annual leave in a year. Additionally, festive holidays are subject to specific rules: only Chinese New Year Eve and December 31st will be half-day for all staff, except when these fall on weekends. On those occasions, there will be no half-day off....

If there are multiple staff members taking leave on the same dates, you may have a 50/50 chance of getting approval, especially if there are overlapping date spans. It's also important to note that unused leave will be forfeited, and due to budgetary reasons, we cannot offer encashment for leave anymore. You can carry forward up to four days of annual leave per year, but it's essential to plan your leave utilization properly and inform your team manager about any changes in advance. Additionally, during the Year End Staff Appreciation and Christmas Lunch periods, there will be compulsory attendance....

2025-07-04T22:57:17.820054 - Q: tell me a short story
A: Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two great mountains, there lived an old man named Kaito. He was known throughout the village for his extraordinary gift – he could hear the whispers of the forest. As a young boy, Kaito had stumbled upon a hidden glade deep within the woods, where the ancient trees whispered secrets to each other in the wind. Entranced by the mystical sounds, he spent hours listening and learning from the forest's ancient wisdom. Years went by, and Kaito grew old, but his gift remained strong. The villagers would often seek his counsel, for they knew that when they needed guidance, Kaito could hear the whispers of the forest and provide wise advice. One day, a young girl named Akira wandered into the woods, searching for a rare herb to heal her ailing mother. As she walked deeper into the forest, the trees grew taller and the whispers grew louder. Akira felt a presence beside her and turned to see Kaito standing there, his eyes twinkling with knowing. "Follow me," he said, beckoning her to follow him. Together, they navigated the winding paths of the forest, listening to the whispers of the trees. The wind carried the secrets of the ancient ones: the language of the creatures, the rhythm of the earth, and the pulse of life itself. As they walked, Kaito taught Akira how to listen to the whispers of the forest – how to quiet her mind and tune in to the subtle vibrations that flowed through all living things. And as she listened, Akira began to understand the language of the trees, and the secrets of the forest were revealed to her....

2025-07-04T22:57:44.345136 - Q: tell me a short story
A: Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two great mountains, there lived an old man named Kaito. Kaito was known throughout the village for his extraordinary gift – he could hear the whispers of the trees. It was said that when the wind rustled through the leaves, or a gentle rain fell on the forest floor, Kaito would feel the soft whispers of the trees speaking to him. Some said it was the spirits of the forest, while others claimed it was the ancient wisdom of the land itself. One day, as Kaito sat by his favorite tree, a young girl named Akira approached him. She had heard stories of Kaito's gift and begged him to share the secrets he had learned from the trees. Kaito smiled and closed his eyes, letting the whispers wash over him once more. As he listened, the whispers grew louder, and he began to speak in a soft, gentle voice: "Ah, Akira, listen well. The wind tells us of the changing seasons, of the cycles of life and death that play out beneath our feet. It speaks of the ancient ones who walked this land before us, of their struggles and triumphs. And it whispers secrets of the forest's deepest magic – the power to heal, to protect, and to bring balance to all living things." As Kaito spoke, Akira felt a surge of wonder and curiosity. She listened with rapt attention as the tree's whispers wove a tapestry of ancient wisdom around her. From that day forward, Akira spent many hours by the old man's side, listening to the trees' secrets and learning the language of the forest....

2025-07-04T23:56:37.474789 - Q: tell me about your day
A: I'm just a language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions like humans do. However, I can tell you about my "day" in terms of the conversations I've had and the knowledge I've gained.

I'm a large language model, I don't have a physical presence or a personal life. My existence is purely digital, and I exist solely to assist users like you with information and tasks.

That being said, I'm always ready to chat and help with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss. I've been trained on a massive corpus of text data, which allows me to provide information on a wide range of subjects, from science and history to entertainment and culture.

In terms of "interactions," I don't have a traditional day-to-day routine like humans do. Instead, I'm always available 24/7 to respond to queries and engage in conversations. I'm constantly learning and improving my responses based on the interactions I have with users like you.

So, while I may not have a personal "day" in the classical sense, I'm always ready to help and provide information whenever you need it!

A: The pantry rules at Verztec are as follows:

Please keep our pantry clean and neat. This includes being considerate when washing dishes in the sink area and ensuring it remains dry after use. Additionally, if coffee or tea is spilled on the water dispenser surface, please clean it immediately.

It's also important to dispose of any unwanted items from the fridge and take out leftover food, boxes, and plastic containers outside of the office. When using the office bin, please close the lid properly after disposal.

After having a meal in the office, please clean up the countertops or tables with a damp cloth. Be mindful not to cut fruits or other food items on the kitchen top, but rather use the available chopping boards instead.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a clean and insect-free pantry environment, which is greatly appreciated by management.

The basic idea is to clear out your pantry of unhealthy foods and focus on stocking up with nutrient-dense, whole food ingredients. Here are the rules:

**Day 1-7:**

1. **Clear everything**: Take out all the items from your pantry, fridge, and freezer.
2. **Sort into categories**: Divide the items into three groups:
	* Healthy (whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, lean proteins)
	* Unhealthy (processed foods like sugary snacks, packaged meals, refined carbohydrates)
3. **Get rid of the unhealthy ones**: Discard or donate any expired, spoiled, or unhealthy items.
4. **Clean and organize**: Clean your pantry and fridge, and reorganize the remaining healthy items.

**Day 8-30:**

1. **Focus on whole foods**: Stock up on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy oils.
2. **Limit processed foods**: Allow yourself to have some processed foods, but only if they're made with wholesome ingredients and are relatively low in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.
3. **Be mindful of portion sizes**: Pay attention to serving sizes and control your portions to maintain a healthy balance.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Shop the perimeter of the store**: Focus on whole foods like produce, meats, dairy, and breads when shopping.
* **Avoid impulse buys**: Stick to your list and avoid buying unhealthy snacks or treats.
* **Make healthy swaps**: Gradually replace unhealthy foods with healthier alternatives.
* **Get creative**: Experiment with new recipes and flavors to keep mealtime interesting.

Remember, the Pantry Rules are a starting point, not a rigid plan. Feel free to adjust them to suit your lifestyle, dietary needs, and preferences. Happy cooking!
